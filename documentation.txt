WineDatabase+

	Our goal is to make a database for wine warehouses, which they will use for buying, maintaining, and selling wines. Buying from wholesalers, winemakers, (factories, vineyards, independent), and selling to business entities like wine bars, restaurants, liquor stores, etc. The superentities will be the wine, business_entity, orders, payment_method and a standalone entity will be orderLine. A redWine, whiteWine, amberWine, sparklingWine ISA wine. A sale and a purchase ISA order, order is a superclass. A winemaker and a customer ISA business_entity. card and wire ISA payment_method. orderLine is a middleman class to support multiple types of wines being sold, with different attributes, since many-to-many relationships arenâ€™t allowed in classic ER diagrams.


Assignment2:

I decided to use the ALT3, since it makes the most centralized version which is easier to track
and to change.

I basically create one large table with all the attributes called e.g. wine, and then add all the attributes
that the ISA inherited entities carry. To differentiate the sub-entities I then create 4 attributes called:
is_redwine
is_whitewine
is_amberwine
is_sparklingwine

and with the view function of MySQL, I create views for each type of wine, which checks for the validity
of these attributes. This is carried over to all of the other super-entities.
